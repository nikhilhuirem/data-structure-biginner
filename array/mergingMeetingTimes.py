'''
    Problem Statement: Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.

    To do this, youâ€™ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. In HiCal, a meeting is stored as a tuple of integers (start_time, end_time). These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.
